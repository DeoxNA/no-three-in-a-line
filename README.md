# No Three In A Line
Maximal solution generator for the No-Three-In-A-Line pronlem. 

To compile the code, simply run
```sh
make
```
in the `tests` directory. The executables will be placed in the `test/build` directory. 

The `halt_if_maximal` program will run until a maximal solution is found. The `halt_after_iter` program will execute a fixed number of runs and print any maximal solutions found (if any).
